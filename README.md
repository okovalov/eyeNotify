eyeNotify
========

A simple tool for reminding users to take a "vision break" according to the 20/20/20 rule recommended by Optometrists: Every 20 minutes, stare at something 20 ft. away for 20 seconds in order to reduce eye strain.

## Installation

Using this tool is simple. It is browser-based, so all you need to do is have both HTML files in the same directory, and open "index.html" in a web browser. That's it!
